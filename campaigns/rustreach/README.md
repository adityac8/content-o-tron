# Rust Reach Campaign

Place your blog post drafts here, if they are not part of an existing Content-o-Tron :robot: blogging campaign.

## What is Rust Reach?

Rust Reach is a project to get more people involved in Rust projects and also in Rust, the language.

The program matches Rust team members from all parts of the project with individuals who are underrepresented in Rust's community and the tech industry for a partnership of three months. Each partnership agrees to a commitment of 3â€“5 hours per week working on a Rust Project. If you are interested to know more, you can visit the [website](http://reach.rust-lang.org/).

## What this campaign is all about?

Through this campaign, we encourage  Rust project members writing about their experiences with being involved in Rust. The tone should be encouraging and welcoming. You can have a look at an example [here](https://yakshav.es/how-I-came-to-rust/). It doesn't have to be that long.

### Need help?

If you have any doubts, you can join our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/content-o-tron/Lobby) channel. We have an active community of members who are ready to help you with your doubts. If you want, you can raise an issue [here](https://github.com/rust-community/content-o-tron/issues). Make sure you follow our issue template.
